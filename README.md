# IrDashboard

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 16.2.1.

## Instructions for updating the data showed in the app
1. Update the `./src/assets/table_data.json` file (must be kept with the same name and in the same location)
    - The json file must be a list of dictionaries where the keys will be the names of the columns and their
    values the values of the entry in the row.
2. Execute `ng build --configuration=production`, where it will generate the new app files in the `./docs` folder
3. Push the files in the `./docs` in the repository 
    - `git add ./docs`
    - `git commit -m "New app distribution files"`
    - `git push`

## Development server
