I am a first year PhD student in Artificial Intelligence at the [Fundamental AI (FunAI) Lab](https://fundamentalailab.github.io/), University of Technology Nuremberg (UTN), specializing in leveraging Self-Supervised Learning and synthetic data to enhance the capabilities of Vision Models. Before this, I graduated cum laude with a Master's in AI from the University of Amsterdam, where I also participated in the Ellis MSc Honours Programme for my thesis research, supervised by [Prof. Yuki M. Asano](https://yukimasano.github.io), [Dr. Gertjan Burghouts](https://gertjanburghouts.github.io/), and [Prof. Francesco Locatello](https://www.francescolocatello.com) while working at TNO. I got my Bachelor's in Computer Science, with a focus on AI, from the University of Cyprus graduating with the second-highest GPA in my department.

My research journey has included internships at Amazon, where I improved efficiency across systems, and at South Pole, where I enhanced CO₂ product-category matching algorithms. I also co-developed "Fooderloo," a project addressing food waste in Cyprus. With a passion for pushing the boundaries of AI, I actively contribute to the field, including publishing work in ICLR and exploring reproducibility in AI research.

When not immersed in research, I enjoy music, cycling and generally sports, as well as exploring the world, new ideas and challenges, all guided by curiosity and a drive to make a meaningful impact in AI.
